# Community Control Over Police Surveillance

Guiding principles were put together by a number of non-profit groups including the ACLU, EFF, and Fight for the Future and are available at https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/ccops_guiding_principles_-_final.pdf

There's also a model bill that implements those principles here: https://www.aclu.org/files/communitycontrol/ACLU-Local-Surveillance-Technology-Model-City-Council-Bill-January-2017.pdf

Plus, a modified version of the model bill that also addresses militarization of police:https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/aclu_ccopsm_surveillance_military_equipment_model_bill_september_2017.pdf
