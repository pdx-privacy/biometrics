First, the CCOPS links...

As I mentioned, the Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS) guiding principles were put together by a number of non-profit groups including the ACLU, EFF, and Fight for the Future and are available here:

There's also a model bill that implements those principles here:

Plus, a modified version of the model bill that also addresses militarization of police:

Oakland currently has in place the strongest protections in the country, and their policy document is located here:

I forgot to mention yesterday that I also have concerns with what Amazon is doing these days. Hereâ€™s a recent article that explains some of the issues:
